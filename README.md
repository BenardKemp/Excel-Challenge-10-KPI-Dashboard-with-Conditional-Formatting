# SolveWithExcel – Challenge #10
## KPI Dashboard with Conditional Formatting

This challenge focuses on turning KPI dashboards into actionable visual tools using Excel’s conditional formatting. You will enhance a KPI summary by applying rules that automatically highlight positive and negative performance.

This pattern is essential for executive dashboards and exception-based reporting.

Difficulty

Intermediate

Estimated Time

30–40 minutes

# The Problem

KPIs only work when insights are immediately visible.
Conditional formatting allows dashboards to signal performance without explanation.

Your task is to:

Calculate core KPI metrics
Apply conditional formatting rules
Make performance trends obvious at a glance
All formatting must be rule-driven and dynamic.

# Dataset

MonthlySales columns:

Month (date-formatted)

Sales

The dataset represents a six-month reporting window and is reused from Challenge #9.

# Your Tasks

## 1. KPI Calculations

On a Dashboard worksheet, calculate:

Latest Month Sales
Previous Month Sales
Month-over-Month Change (%)
Status (Up / Down / Flat)
6-Month Average Sales

All values must update automatically.

## 2. Conditional Formatting Rules

Apply the following rules:

Month-over-Month Change %
Green fill if value > 0
Red fill if value < 0
Neutral if value = 0

Status Label

Green for "Up"
Red for "Down"
Gray for "Flat"

Latest vs Average
Green if Latest Month Sales > 6-Month Average
Red if Latest Month Sales < 6-Month Average

# Requirements

Use Excel conditional formatting rules only

No manual coloring

Rules must update dynamically when data changes
